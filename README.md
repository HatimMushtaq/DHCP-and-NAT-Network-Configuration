# 🛰️ DHCP and NAT Network Configuration

> **Cisco Packet Tracer project demonstrating DHCP, NAT, VLAN, and Wi-Fi configuration for real-world network automation.**

---

## 🧾 Project Description

This project demonstrates the configuration and integration of **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** and **NAT (Network Address Translation)** in a simulated enterprise network environment using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  

The setup includes:
- ⚙️ **DHCP** for automated IP allocation to multiple devices across VLANs  
- 🌍 **NAT Overload (PAT)** to enable secure internet access for internal hosts  
- 📶 **Wi-Fi Access Point** integration for wireless connectivity  
- 🧱 **VLAN configuration** for segmenting network traffic and improving security  

This project replicates **real-world IT infrastructure setups** and helps networking learners understand how DHCP and NAT work together to manage and optimize IP addressing and communication.
